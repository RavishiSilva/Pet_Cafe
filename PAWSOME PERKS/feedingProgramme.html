		<p class="volunteer" align="center"> Pawsome Perks's highly anticipated Doggy Feeding Program is back for its sixth year and is scheduled for December 10th, 2024. We are excited to announce that we are in search of 50 compassionate volunteers to participate in this heartwarming initiative. We have dedicated 10% of our monthly proceeds to make a positive impact on the lives of dogs in Colombo. </p>

		<p class="volunteer" align="center">The origins of our Doggy Feeding Program dates back to seven years when we first met our Leo girl, who was cold and hungry on the streets, inspired us to take action.</p>

		<p class="volunteer" align="center">As we prepare for the sixth edition of our Doggy Feeding Program, we invite kind-hearted individuals to join us and making a meaningful contribution to the lives of dogs in need. By volunteering, you become an essential part of our collective effort to provide nourishment  nearly 500 dogs in Colombo. This program embodies the spirit of Pawsome Perks, where love, compassion, and a deep commitment to the doggy community come together. We look forward to celebrate this milestone continuing to spread love and kindness through. <br> Kindly fill this form "<b><a href=form.html>Become a Volunteer!</a></b>" to get registered with the program.</p>
