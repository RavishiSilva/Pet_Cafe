<h1 class="aboutus">About Us</h1>

<p class="about"> Since 2018, Pawsome Perks is the perfect place to refresh with good food and the most lovable dogs and cats around. We take our job seriously as a fun pet-friendly cafe in Sri Lanka. All you need to do is buy a cover charge ticket to hang out with these fur buddies. We provide customers with the opportunity to purchase food to feed our buddies if you come between 11 to 3 p.m. Customers are also usually informed that they should not bother sleeping buddies, pick up buddies or use any sort of flash photography on the premises. A pawsome place for a pawsome date with the love of your life!</p>
